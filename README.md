### Hej hej, I'm Hannah!

👋 I’m a newly graduated software developer, seeking an entry-level / junior position where I can grow, adapt and learn as much as possible.

🧑🏻‍💻 Passionate about solving user problems with technology, I enjoy all aspects of the development process - from planning to delivery, where communication and documentation is a key value.

🌍 I’m based in Linköping, Sweden but open to remote and hybrid solutions outside of Östergötland. Fluent in Swedish and English!

🎯 Chairperson/president of a local cultural association, and part-time historic guide at Vadstena Castle.
